      <h3>Pierce College MakerSpace branding</h3>
      <p>Created the logo for the brand new maker space, so fun to explore what works when vinyl cutting a logo! Deciding colors and what they can repsresent in terms of the tools and machines available in the space was an adventure.</p>

      <h3>EWU Student Research & Creative Works Symposium facelift</h3>
      <p>I designed the new logo for the Symposium as the US was gearing up to shut down for COVID-19, oh the before times.</p>

      <h3>What's Your Record fantasy record store</h3>

    <div class="About-Me">
      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I just want to make good stuff. Good design has clear and ingestible information, so why not make it pleasing and fun? Being able to decorate the information we read and take in is part of the fun. Whether making posters, fliers, or adverts, cover art, or branding, it is about making sure your best foot is forward.</p>
      <p>I have an AAS in Digital Design and am quickly making my way towards a Bachelors of Design from EWU, I know I’ve learned a great deal about what good design is, but I’ve also learned a lot about who I am as a designer, and that there's more joy and good that comes from not taking yourself too seriously. If good design is good, why not have fun in the process? I enjoy crafting in its many forms — from painting and drawing to felt cut-outs and cross stitch, so taking my designs to a digital medium is second nature.</p>
